# Employee Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to identify key factors affecting employee attrition and builds machine learning models to predict attrition.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle categorical variables
- Treat outliers using IQR method
- Apply Feature Scaling
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Train ML models (SVM, Random Forest, ANN)
- Compare model performance
- Save best model using Pickle

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Pickle

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Network (MLP Classifier)

## Best Model
Artificial Neural Network (MLP Classifier)

## How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells
3. Ensure dataset is in same folder
